# Budget Bolt: Target Platforms

Budget Bolt is designed as a cross-platform application, with current support for Windows web environment and planned support for iOS devices. This document outlines the current status and future plans for platform support.

## Windows Web Implementation

**Status: Implemented** âœ…

The primary platform for Budget Bolt is currently a web application optimized for Windows environments.

### Technical Implementation

- Built using React Native Web and Expo
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Local storage for data persistence

### Features

All core features of Budget Bolt are fully functional in the Windows web implementation:
- Account management
- Budget interface
- Transaction management
- Rule-based categorization
- Data import/export
- Financial calendar
- Historical data and reporting
- Account reconciliation
- Customizable dashboard
- Net worth tracking
- Trend analysis
- Bank API integration
- Mobile/Desktop sync

### Current Limitations

- Limited offline support
- Performance may vary with large datasets
- Some advanced visualizations may be limited by web capabilities

### Planned Enhancements

- Enhanced offline support with service workers
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- Performance optimizations for large datasets
- More native-like interactions

## iOS Implementation

**Status: Planned** ðŸ”„

iOS support is currently in development, leveraging React Native's cross-platform capabilities.

### Technical Implementation

- Built using React Native and Expo
- Native iOS components and interactions
- iOS-specific UI optimizations
- Local storage with AsyncStorage

### Development Status

The core structure for iOS support exists in the codebase, but specific iOS optimizations are still in progress:
- Basic functionality should work on iOS
- UI needs refinement for touch interactions
- Performance testing on iOS devices is pending
- App Store preparation is planned

### Planned Enhancements

- iOS-specific UI optimizations
- Touch interaction refinements
- Performance optimizations for iOS devices
- App Store deployment
- iOS-specific features (Touch ID/Face ID integration)

### Timeline

iOS support is targeted for completion in Q3 2025, with beta testing planned for Q2 2025.

## Future Platform Support

### Android

**Status: Future Plan** ðŸ“…

Android support is planned as a future enhancement, with initial assessment scheduled for Q4 2025.

#### Considerations for Android Implementation

- React Native compatibility assessment
- Android-specific UI adaptations
- Google Play Store requirements
- Performance testing on various Android devices

### Desktop Applications

**Status: Under Consideration** ðŸ¤”

Native desktop applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux are under consideration for future development.

#### Potential Implementation Approaches

- Electron-based desktop application
- React Native for Windows/macOS
- Progressive Web App with enhanced capabilities

## Cross-Platform Considerations

### Data Synchronization

Budget Bolt implements a robust synchronization system to ensure data consistency across platforms:
- Cloud-based synchronization
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Offline-first architecture
- End-to-end encryption for data security

### User Experience Consistency

While adapting to platform-specific conventions, Budget Bolt maintains consistency in:
- Core functionality
- Visual design language
- Interaction patterns
- Feature parity (where technically feasible)

### Platform-Specific Optimizations

Each platform implementation includes optimizations for:
- Input methods (touch vs. mouse/keyboard)
- Screen sizes and orientations
- Platform-specific authentication methods
- Performance characteristics

## Development Priorities

The current platform development priorities are:
1. Enhance and optimize Windows web implementation
2. Complete iOS implementation and App Store deployment
3. Assess and plan Android implementation
4. Consider native desktop applications
