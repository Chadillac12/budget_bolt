## Theming Architecture Investigation Results

- Current architecture uses React Native Paper themes partially, but not optimally
- ThemeContext provides theme state but lacks PaperProvider integration
- Many components use hard-coded colors instead of theme colors
- Inconsistent application of theme across components
- Found black background with black text in dark mode for some components
- No standard theme provider wrapper at the app root level
- Custom themed components are created but not consistently applied
- Some screens respect the theme while others don't

## Open Questions/Issues

- How to efficiently integrate PaperProvider into the existing ThemeContext architecture
- Best approach for migrating hard-coded styles to use theme-aware components
- Strategy for consistent application of theming across all screens
- Implementation of themed components for form elements, buttons, etc.
- How to handle theme transitions and ensure proper rerendering
- Prioritization of remaining missing features
- Technical approach for CSV import/export
- UI requirements for financial forecasting

## Next Steps

- Continue refactoring remaining components with hardcoded colors
  - Focus on modals, forms, and specialized UI components
  - Develop a systematic approach to identify and update all hardcoded colors
- Create a theming utility script to automatically detect and suggest replacements for hardcoded colors
- Continue implementation of global theming architecture improvements
- Integrate PaperProvider at the root level of the application
- Create additional themed components for common UI elements
- Update screens to use the themed components consistently
- Begin implementation of financial calendar with forecasting feature
- Plan for goal tracking system implementation
