## Current Tasks - Global Theming Architecture Improvements

We're addressing issues with the current theming implementation to ensure dark/light mode is applied correctly and consistently throughout the app. Our investigation revealed key problems:

1. **Current Implementation Issues:**
   - The app uses a custom ThemeContext but lacks PaperProvider integration
   - Many components use hardcoded colors rather than theme colors
   - ThemedScreen, ThemedCard, and ThemedText components exist but aren't used consistently
   - Theme transitions don't always trigger proper rerendering
   - Some screens show black background with black text in dark mode
   - Missing themed versions of form controls, buttons, and modals

2. **Solution Architecture:**
   - Implement PaperProvider at the root level with combined theme from ThemeContext
   - Extend existing themed components to support all necessary UI patterns
   - Create a migration strategy for screen and component styles
   - Ensure proper accessibility for both theme modes
   - Follow React Native Paper best practices for theme transitions

3. **Implementation Plan:**
   - Update app root with PaperProvider integration
   - Create a typed useAppTheme hook for better TypeScript support
   - Implement themed versions of all common UI components
   - Update layout components to use theme-aware styling
   - Systematically update all screens to use the theme system

## Next Steps

1. **Theme Architecture Updates:**
   - Create a theming utility script to detect and suggest replacements for hardcoded colors
   - Continue refactoring remaining components with hardcoded colors
   - Integrate PaperProvider in app/_layout.tsx
   - Create useAppTheme typed hook with complete theme definition
   - Extend ThemedScreen, ThemedCard, ThemedText for full compatibility
   - Add themed versions of Button, Input, Modal components
   - Create a theme migration guide document

2. **Screen Updates:**
   - Apply themed components to all (tabs) screens
   - Update modals and forms to use themed components
   - Ensure proper contrast in all theme combinations
   - Test theme transitions and persistence

3. **Future Features:**
   - Complete CSV import/export functionality
   - Design financial forecasting system
   - Implement customizable dashboard
   - Begin financial calendar with forecasting implementation
   - Plan goal tracking system development
